/**
 * This is a pre-security-scan script that will run after the security scan is complete.
 * It should be removed if jest is on version 30 or higher. This is a short term fix for jest using glob v7 (https://github.com/jestjs/jest/releases | https://github.com/jestjs/jest/pull/14509).
 * This isn't a security risk because glob is a devDependency and is only used in the scripts/test environment.
